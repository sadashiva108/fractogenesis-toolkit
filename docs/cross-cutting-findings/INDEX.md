# Cross-cutting findings

Finding bundles that are not specific to one runbook — shared helpers under
`.internal/`, the run-index and sign-off machinery, the repo-wide lints, the
instruction set itself.

A finding felt in one runbook belongs under `docs/runbook-findings/<runbook>/`.
The test is where the ramifications are **functionally** impactful, not where
they are incidentally impactful because a shared script needs refactoring:
scripts and artifacts are covered by their owning runbook. A bundle lands here
only when the change is broad and agnostic to any particular runbook, and may
affect more than one.

**The bundle layout, the status vocabulary and the numbering rule are defined
once**, in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` section 4c. This file carries the
rows and nothing else.

Each bundle also carries a `STATUS-<status>` tag file so a directory listing
answers the status without opening anything. The row here is authoritative; a
tag that disagrees with it is a bug in whoever moved the bundle last.
